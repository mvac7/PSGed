==Requirements==

To operate the PSGed, minimal configuration is required as a first generation MSX PAL (60Hz), computer with 16K of RAM.

The optimal configuration would be an MSX2 or higher PAL computer,(improved color palette), with a mouse.

You can also run on MSX emulators for other computers and consoles that allow ROM format files.
